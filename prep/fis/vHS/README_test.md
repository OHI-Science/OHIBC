This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for Wild-Capture Fisheries for the OHIBC assessment.

More information about this goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#food-provision).

## Data management and citation info

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!

## Directory information

This directory includes R/Rmd scripts and .html files, as well as subdirectories that include metadata, intermediate data, figures, and output layers for the indicated assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

## OHIBC Howe Sound: Wild capture fisheries

### Summary:

The Fisheries goal for Howe Sound will be calculated based on only important local shrimp fishery.  The OHIBC scores will be calculated in the same manner as for the OHI California Current assessment (Halpern et al., 2014), based upon rescaled fishing pressure (F') and biomass condition (B').
