## Data management and citation info

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!

## Directory information

The directories in this goal directory include metadata, R/Rmd scripts, intermediate data processing, and layer outputs for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted, for OHIBC currently only 2017) or scenario (e.g. Howe Sound OHIBC assessment).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

### Summary:

The Fisheries goal for Howe Sound will be calculated based on only important local shrimp fishery.  The OHIBC scores will be calculated in the same manner as for the OHI California Current assessment (Halpern et al., 2014), based upon rescaled fishing pressure (F') and biomass condition (B').
