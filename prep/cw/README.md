## Directory information

The directories in this goal directory include metadata, R/Rmd scripts, intermediate data processing, and layer outputs for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted, for OHIBC currently only 2017) or scenario (e.g. Howe Sound OHIBC assessment).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.
