## Fishing pressures

### Commercial fishing: high bycatch

From OHI Global 2012: 
> This Pressure represents fish caught using high bycatch gear, which includes demersal destructive (e.g. trawl), demersal non-destructive high bycatch (e.g. pots, traps) and pelagic high bycatch (e.g. long-lines) gear. The species-gear associations are from Watson et al.79. Catch data come from 2006 and were spatialized by the Sea Around Us Project into 1⁄2 degree cell resolution 31. We then summed these values into our EEZ reporting units. When cells spanned EEZ borders, we divided catch proportionally based on amount of area in each EEZ. Full details on the data that comprise this layer are provided in Halpern et al.3.

### Commercial fishing: low bycatch

From OHI Global 2012: 
> This Pressure represents fish caught using low bycatch gear, which includes demersal non-destructive low bycatch (e.g. hook and line) and pelagic low bycatch (e.g. purse seines) gear. The species-gear associations are from Watson et al. 79. Catch data come from 2006 and were spatialized by the Sea Around Us Project into 1⁄2 degree cell resolution 31. We then summed these values into our EEZ reporting units. When cells spanned EEZ borders, we divided catch proportionally based on amount of area in each EEZ. Full details on the data that comprise this layer are provided in Halpern et al.3.

### Artisanal fishing: high bycatch

From OHI Global 2012: 
> Reefs at Risk Revisited77 recorded the presence of destructive artisanal blast and poison (cyanide) fishing in a country based on survey observations and expert opinion. Because these data are categorical, we used a binary system for scoring regions for this stressor. Where destructive artisanal fishing practices were recorded as either "moderate" or "severe," we categorized the value as maximum (score = 1). "Unclassified" areas are considered under low threat from blast and poison fishing by Reefs at Risk Revisited and were categorized as having no artisanal high bycatch fishing (score = 0).

> A notable limitation of using these data as a proxy for high bycatch artisanal fishing is that they only cover coral reef habitats. High bycatch artisanal fishing likely exists in every coastal country on the planet, but we have no way of knowing the type or extent (for every country). For all non-habitat destructive (but still potentially high bycatch) fishing we use FAO catch data (described below in Artisanal Fishing: Low Bycatch).

### Artisanal fishing: low bycatch

From OHI Global 2012: 
> FAO reports statistics on this type of catch for many but not all countries; we used data for 59 countries reported in 2006 and modeled the values for the remaining countries. There is no information on the gear type used for this catch; we make the assumption that little of it is done with habitat- destructive gear (e.g., blast fishing) or high bycatch gear (e.g., seine nets) but recognize that high bycatch gear in particular is common. However, we used a separate dataset for destructive artisanal fishing practices (see "Artisanal Fishing: High Bycatch" above). Full details on this data layer are provided in Halpern et al.3.

### Targeted harvest

From OHI Global 2012: 
> This data layer compiles data from FAO 82 on catch of cetaceans and marine turtles. We searched and extracted all catch titles that could include cetaceans or marine turtles and aggregated to create a total reported catch count for cetaceans and tonnes caught for marine turtles for each country. Reported catch for 2009 was used for most countries unless data were unavailable for 2009 and there was a reported catch for 2008. In those cases, 2008 data were used. For both cetaceans and marine turtles the summed catch was rescaled from 0-1, with 1 = 110% the maximum value across all countries. The two scores were then averaged to create a single "targeted harvest" score.

## Habitat destruction pressures

NOTE: Hard bottom habitat destructive fishing is excluded from BC assessment.

### EBSA

This layer will be identical to the HAB EBSA pressure layer (1 - status).  This is based on presence of trawling, based on data from DFO trawl fisheries, on habitat identified as corals, sponges, seamounts, and hydrothermal vents.

### Subtidal soft bottom

This layer will be identical to the HAB soft bottom pressure layer (1 - status).  This is based on trawl effort in hours, from DFO trawl fisheries, on habitat identified as sand or mud based on BCMCA data.

### Intertidal

From OHI Global 2012: 
> The intertidal habitat destruction proxy measures the coastal population density within 10 km of the coast based on the assumption that the potential for intertidal habitat destruction is proportional to the density of human population living along the coast.  We extracted population density for the most recent year, 2000 (see human coastal population layer; (CIESIN), resampled our 10 km buffer raster to match the GPWv3 resolution (2.5 arc-min). We marked the coastline edge pixels for the population data, log- rescaled the value to the global maximum within the edge pixels plus 10%, and then calculated the zonal mean population density score for each region.

From OHI CC 2014:
> To estimate the impact of direct human trampling we used a model developed by Halpern et al. (2009) that utilized California actual beach attendance data to develop a predictive model of beach visitation across all regions included in the U.S. west coast. Predicted beach visitation values were used to score this pressure using 110% of the maximum visitation value recorded as the maximum pressure score, and zero visitations as the minimum. These values were then averaged across our sub-regions.

___Use park attendance values from TR goal?  do all regions have parks?  or use GPW v4?___

## Climate change pressures

All climate pressures are extracted from pressures layers used in the global assessment.  UV and SST reference points are set at 50% of weeks being anomalous (> mean + 1 sd).  OA reference point is aragonite sat state of 1, with changes closer to 1 being scored more highly.  SLR reference point will be based on a local maximum.


## Water pollution pressures

### Chemicals, Nutrients, Marine debris

These pressure layers are identical to the layers used in the OHIBC Clean Waters goal.

### Human pathogens

From OHI Global 2012: 
> The percentage of the population with access to improved sanitation facilities (World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund, Joint Monitoring Programme, 2011) was used in combination with measurements of population density64 as a proxy for pathogens in coastal waters. Access to improved sanitation facilities is defined as the percentage of the population within a country with at least adequate access to excreta disposal facilities that can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact with excreta. These data are a country-wide average (not specific to the coastal region) and the most recent year available is 2008. Percentages (0-100) for each country were rescaled to 0-1 based on a maximum target of 100% of the population with access to improved sanitation, and a minimum value of 0.

___Shellfish closures for sanitation?___


## Species pollution pressures

### Invasive species

The invasive species pressures layer was created using the 2008 Molnar dataset used in OHI Global and CC, but with a different method to better capture the ecological pressure of each invasive species.  Each species was given an invasive pressure score based on geometric mean of _invasive potential_, _ecological impact_, and _management difficulty_ (each rated 1-4, 4 being high).  For each Marine Ecoregion, we calculated the sum of the invasive pressures of all species in the region; then rescaled based on the highest total invasive pressure score across all ecoregions.


### Genetic escapes

From OHI Global 2012: 
> This layer represents the potential for harmful genetic escapement based on whether the species being cultured is native or introduced. Data come from the Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) 34. In the MSI analysis native species receive the highest score (10), while foreign and introduced species receive the lowest (1) on the premise of potential impacts to local biodiversity if these species were to escape. Use of native but non-local species were scored intermediately based on the assumption that potentially negative alterations to genetic biodiversity occur from non-local sources as well, but to a lower degree. Genetic "pollution" can arise when larvae, spats or seeds escape from poorly managed hatcheries, making native species vulnerable to out- breeding depressions and/or genetic bottlenecks 34. The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 53 countries represented). Where multiple scores exist for a country the weighted average of all scores (0-10) is used. All country scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1, using the maximum raw score of 10 and minimum of 1. Countries that were not analyzed by Trujillo34 did not receive a score and this pressure layer falls out of their analyses.

Similar to the OHI Global and California Current assessments, we use the Trujillo 2008 MSI genetic_escapees scores (divided by 10 to be 0-1) and combine with mariculture harvests from FAO, using Canada Pacific reported harvests.  Species with no MSI score are scored according to analogous species in the MSI dataset (i.e. Chinook salmon and Rainbow trout receive same score as Coho salmon, as native salmonids; scallops nei and Manila clams are scored with genus-average value).  FAO total harvests are spatially allocated using the mean values of DFO-reported harvests used in the OHIBC MAR goal.  Species with no spatial allocation in the DFO data are allocated in same proportions as analogous species (i.e. "Rainbow trout" is spatially allocated in the same proportions as the mean of Coho and Chinook).
