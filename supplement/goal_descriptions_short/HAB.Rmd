### Goal Description

Habitats conditions are considered as a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them.  As in the global OHI calculation, we include soft-bottom benthic habitats and salt marsh.  We did not include seagrass due to data limitations and concerns over an effective pressure model.  For OHIBC we include an additional habitat category: ecologically/biologically significant areas (EBSAs).  EBSAs are noted by the DFO as areas with oceanographic, physical, or ecological conditions with special significance; for our purposes we include only EBSAs related to biodiversity-supporting structure, including sponge reefs, deep water corals, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts.  The Habitats sub-goal assess the health condition of each habitat present in a region, based upon external pressures (for soft-bottom habitat and ecologically/biologically significant areas (EBSAs)) and coverage area relative to historical baseline (for saltmarsh habitats).

### Model & Data 

The Habitat model is a simple mean (not area-weighted, as in CPP or CSS) of the health status of each habitat present in a region.  Subtidal soft bottom habitat health is the inverse of average trawl _effort_ across the region (i.e. hours of trawl per km^2), while EBSA health is the inverse of the average trawl presence (i.e. trawled area relative to total EBSA area) since these slow-growing structures are far slower to recover than soft bottom sediment.  Saltmarsh health is calculated as the current extent relative to a historical reference.

### Reference points 

Reference points differ for each habitat.  Subtidal soft bottom habitat health is scaled 0 (no trawl effort) to 1 (maximum trawl effort in any cell with soft-bottom habitat); EBSA health is scaled 0 (no trawl effort) to 1 (trawling occurs in entire EBSA area); salt marsh health is scaled 0 to 1 based on the proportion of current salt marsh extent relative to historical baseline (1990 based upon land use raster).
