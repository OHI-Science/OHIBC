### Goal Description

Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a speciesâ€™ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., tourist attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). This sub-goal assesses how well those species are conserved.

### Model 

The Iconic Species model measures the percentage of iconic species in each extinction risk category. Species list is based upon input from Karin Bodtker and Andrew Day of the Vancouver Aquarium/CORI project. Threat weights were assigned based on the COSEWIC province-level threat status where available (covering most species on the list) and IUCN threat categories status (for species without a COSEWIC assessment).  In addition to including only a subset of species in the SPP goal, the ICO goal is not based on area-weighted average of species within a region, only on whether a species is present within a region.

### Reference points 

The reference point corresponds to risk status of all assessed species as Least Concern.
