### Goal Description

The Carbon Storage goal captures the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given their carbon uptake rate and health conditions. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts. For BC we also include coastal forests, here defined as forested areas within sub-watersheds incident with the coastline.

### Model

Goal model measures the current ‘condition’ of habitats relative to reference conditions, weighted by the relative contribution of each habitat type to total carbon sequestration, using data from (Laffoley & Grimsditch 2009) (Halpern 2015 final). 

Two coastal habitats known to provide meaningful amounts of carbon storage were included in this goal: coastal forests and salt marshes. Habitat conditions are measured by their coverage area, and their relative carbon sequestration are weighted: XXX *** REFS *** .  We excluded seagrasses from this analysis, as time-series data on extent and health were not available; however, they likely provide significant sequestration along the BC coast. 

### Reference points 

We use a temporal reference point (ie. coverage data of a historical point) for each type of habitat. For both saltmarsh and coastal forest extent, we consider 1990 as a baseline due to limited data availability prior to that.  <!-- for saltmarsh in Howe Sound, we modify that baseline using historical records that indicate an average 30% loss relative to historical extents.  This is not currently implemented for OHIBC.-->
