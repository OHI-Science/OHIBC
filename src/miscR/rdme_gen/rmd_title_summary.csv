From Molnar (2008) data, we have data on the number of invasive species (and number of harmful invasives) found within each Marine Ecoregion of the World (MEOW) region.  For the global assessment and California Current, score is determined based on the proportion of invasives relative to the global maximum.  For OHIBC, we will instead use a species-by-species pressure based on three criteria: _invasive potential_, _ecological impact_, and _management difficulty_.  In Molnar 2008, each of these (as well as _scope_) is ranked on a 1 to 4 scale, with 1 being minimal and 4 being intense.  Invasive pressure of a species is a geometric mean (rescaled to max = 1) of these threat criteria:

$$pressure_{spp} = P_{spp} = \frac{\prod_{T=1}^N(threat_T)^{1/N}}{4}$$
where T is a threat criterion, N is number of threat criteria scores for that species (excluding NAs).

Scores for each OHIBC region are the area-weighted total species pressure from each ecoregion present.  This assumes that invasive species are uniformly distributed throughout the ecoregion.

$$X_{invasive} = \frac{\sum_{ecorgn=1}^{N}((\sum_{spp=1}^M P_{spp})  * A_{ecorgn})}{\sum_{ecorgn=1}^N A_{ecorgn}}$$

The maximum value a cell could have is 52 which would mean that cell had anomalous SST temperatures for each week of the year.

To account for annual variation, we look at Sea Surface Temperature anomalous weeks in 5 year periods, so the maximum value possible per cell is 260 anomalous weeks.

This script prepares layers (production potential, area targets, harvest values) for Mariculture sub-goal in British Columbia's coastal regions.  

From Halpern et al. (2012) :

>The Status of the Mariculture sub-goal ($x_{MAR}$), was defined as production of strictly marine taxa from both the marine and brackish water FAO categories, excluding aquatic plants such as kelps and seaweeds, which were assumed to contribute predominantly to medicinal and cosmetic uses rather than as a source of food.

In addition, a sustainability factor is included for the global OHI calculations.

For British Columbia, we will leverage Gentry, Froehlich et al. (2017) to determine aquaculture potential for both shellfish and finfish in BC waters.  For each OHIBC region, the $\Phi'$ value based on a generic portfolio of 120 finfish and 60 bivalves is converted into a time-to-harvest value for each 1-km^2 cell.  These in turn are converted to a potential harvest rate $P_c$ as a function of $\Phi'$.

To determine a reference point, we will create a rescaled harvest potential similar to the $B' = f(B/B_{MSY})$ score for the FIS subgoal.  A score of 1 will reflect a harvest value greater than $\bar{P}(\Phi' - \sigma_{\Phi'})$.  Below the lower bound value, the score tapers linearly to zero (at a harvest of zero) for under-production.  While finfish aquaculture can create environmental problems, we will not impose a sustainability penalty on overproduction as the impact of BC's finfish aquaculture seems to be very low.

The reference point for each region is the product of this rescaled potential harvest rate and the area of existing aquaculture tenures ($A_f$ and $A_s$ for finfish and shellfish respectively) within the region.  Note that MaPP has identified large areas in HG, NC, CC, and NCVI regions for aquaculture, but analogous proposals are not available for WCVI or SG regions.

$$H_{lowR} = \bar{P}(\Phi' - \sigma_{\Phi'}) * A_{tenure}$$

where $H_{lowR}$ is calculated separately for finfish and shellfish aquaculture classes.

Mariculture score $x_c$ for harvest $H_c$, calculated separately for each aquaculture class $c$:

| value           |           | condition |
|: |: |: |
| $x_{shellfish} = H/H_{lowR}$ | when | $0 \leq H_{shellfish} < H_{lowR}$ |
| $x_{shellfish} = 1$ | when | $H_{shellfish} \geq H_{lowR}$ |
| $x_{finfish} = H/H_{lowR}$ | when | $0 \leq H_{finfish} < H_{lowR}$ |
| $x_{finfish} = 1$ | when | $H_{finfish} \geq H_{lowR}$ |

The Mariculture score will be the harvest-weighted average of $x_{finfish}$ and $x_{shellfish}$.

Currently, the Species Richness sub-goal model is identical to the OHI Global 
model: a region's status is based upon an area-weighted average of species
health across each BC reporting region.

From Halpern et al (2012):

> The target for the Species sub-goal is to have all species at a risk status of Least Concern.

The Status of assessed species was calculated as the area- and threat status-weighted average of the number of threatened species within each 0.5 degree grid cell.

For BC, our calculation will be slightly different, though the end result will be identical.

**Species area-weighted risk:**  For each species within a region, the risk score is weighted by the proportion of the species' range within the given region.  To determine the mean area-weighted risk, the area-weighted risks are summed and divided by the total number of species within the region.

From Halpern et al (2012):

> The target for the Species sub-goal is to have all species at a risk status of Least Concern. We scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions and would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity. The Status of assessed species was calculated as the area- and threat status-weighted average of the number of threatened species within each 0.5 degree grid cell.

**Mean risk status for Howe Sound:**

$$\bar{R} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{species}(Risk)}{n_{spp}}$$

**Species goal model**

$$X_{SPP} = \frac{((1 - \bar{R}_{SPP}) - 0.25)}{(1 - 0.25)} * 100%$$

where:

* $X_{SPP}$ is Species goal status
* $\bar{R}$ is mean extinction risk for identified species within Howe Sound (different subsets for ICO and SPP)
* *Risk* is scaled value for species extinction risk category, based on: 
    * 'LC' = 0.0, 'NT' = 0.2, 'VU' = 0.4, 'EN' = 0.6, 'CR' = 0.8, 'EX' = 1.0
* SPP trend is calculated as the linear trend of the average extinction risk categories over time.",1633,FALSE
