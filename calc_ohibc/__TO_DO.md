OHIBC To Do

* shiny app of goal-by-goal
    * show score plot by goal/rgn
    * show res layers by goal/rgn
    * show prs layers by goal/rgn
* finish layers
    * fis: gapfill weighting by region average (or carry back/carry forward)
    * fp_habitat and hd_habitat resilience (trawl reductions)
    * add officer weighting to fp_ and hd_mpa resilience 
* chat with Mel, Court, Jamie, Ben re: gapfilling and consistency
* Fix/check layers
    * cc_slr is NA for 1993-1996?  not necessary for calculations
    * cc_uv is NA for 2005-2008? DONE 
        * Calc based on annual anomalous weeks vs 50% reference point, instead of rolling five-year window that set NA values for the earliest years
* Documentation
    * Compare OHIBC pressure matrix (score by score) against global pressure matrix
        * where different (incl new layers) need to find references to justify scores
