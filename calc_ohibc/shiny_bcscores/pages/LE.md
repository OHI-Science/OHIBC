### Goal Description

The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even for those people who do not directly participate in marine-related industries. People value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. This sub-goal Livelihood describes job quantity and quality for people living on the coast. Livelihoods includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs, which is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages, which is a proxy for job quality.

### Model 

The Livelihood model is based on job and wage data for coastal economic districts.  Employment data by industry was not sufficiently detailed to identify jobs and wages for marine-dependent sectors.  Instead we use a population-weighted average of employment rates and wages across all sectors within the regions that hug the British Columbia coastline.

### Reference points 

Because there is no absolute reference point for jobs (i.e., a target number of jobs would be completely arbitrary), its reference point is calculated as a relative value on a moving baseline: the value in the current year (or most recent year) relative to the value in a recent moving reference period, defined as 5 years prior to the current year. This reflects an implicit goal of maintaining coastal livelihoods and economies on short time scales, allowing for decadal or generational shifts in what people want and expect for coastal livelihoods and economy. <!-- should ref pt be rolling mean of 5 years, or value 5 years ago? -->

For wages we assumed the reference value for average annual wages is the highest value observed across all reporting units.
