## Code

Here is an overview of the organization of files and data.  For more details on general OHI practices and principles [see here](https://ohi-science.org/manual/#file-system-organization):

* The `prep` directory contains scripts and outputs for all data cleaning, preparation, and calculation of data layers for the primary OHIBC assessment.
* The `regionHoweSound` directory contains scripts and outputs for data cleaning, preparation, and calculation of data layers for the prototype OHIBC Howe Sound assessment.
* The `calc_ohibc` directory contains scripts to gather output data layers and process these layers into OHIBC scores and results.
* The `post_analysis` directory contains scripts that analyze scores and results for the PLOS ONE publication.
